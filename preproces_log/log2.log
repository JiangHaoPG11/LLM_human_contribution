The hair, or glam, metal bands of the 1980s remain one of the true guilty pleasures in the history of music. The hair spray, makeup and catchy pop tunes touched up with distortion were made for MTV. Though there really wasn't much substance to the music, the scene was popular to the mainstream nonetheless. So we've decided to rank our 20 hair metal bands of all time. But before we go on, bands like Def Leppard, Kiss, Scorpions, Whitesnake, Extreme and Tesla are not on this list. While, yes, some of these groups made massively successful pop-tinged metal albums during the '80s, they were either already successfully established hard-rock acts before this time and went for some easy money or were unjustly lumped into the genre thanks to MTV. With that said, here we go.
The hair metal bands of the 1980s, known for their glamorous image and catchy pop tunes, continue to be a guilty pleasure for many music fans. Despite lacking substance, these bands gained popularity in the mainstream, particularly through MTV. In this article, we present a ranking of the top 20 hair metal bands of all time. However, it is important to note that established acts like Def Leppard, Kiss, Scorpions, Whitesnake, Extreme, and Tesla are not included in this list. These bands either had prior success in the hard-rock genre or were wrongly associated with hair metal due to MTV's influence. Let's dive into the rankings.

Queer. Black. Woman. Nonbinary. Masculine. Feminine. These are all aspects of one person's identity that they have struggled to fully embrace. Throughout their life, they have felt the need to pick up and put down these different parts of themselves in order to fit into societal expectations. It took them years to come out as queer to their strict, religious, Haitian mother due to the fear of rejection. This personal journey highlights the challenges faced by individuals who do not fit into traditional molds and the importance of acceptance and understanding.

The Battles began on The Voice Monday, with a new set of mentors (Usher, Darius Rucker, Normani, and wil.i.am) and a new rule allowing coaches to save one contestant each from elimination. But before all that, there were a few more Blind Auditions, including one form Season 17's new heartthrob, Matthew McQueen. He may not be related to Steve McQueen, but he had undeniable star power -- with a pretty face and a pretty voice to match plus just the right about of darkness and edge. "He kind of looks like a combination of Tom Cruise and Christian Bale. You're like a very handsome movie villain," John Legend told Matthew. "Like a vampire. You could be in a vampire movie," said Kelly Clarkson, who seemed a little flustered as she called the 21-year-old indie-pop crooner "so cool and sexy -- I mean, not in a weird way!" Blake Shelton compared Matthew's modern-sounding vocals to that of another heartthrob, Shawn Mendes. So I guess music really was in Matthew's, um, blood. [insert/quote some tweets] Matthew's cover artist-of-the-moment's Lewis Capaldi's weeper "Someone You Loved" was haunting, and not just because he looked like Lestat while singing it. I was impressed by his sense of dynamics, the way he started soft and subtle and built the song to its anguished crescendo, instead of starting at full volume. It was a sophisticated and nuanced performance. "You got better and better and you kept it classy, you kept it tasteful. When you get into that rasp -- like, whew," Kelly marveled. It seemed like Kelly might be on her way to a third victory by getting Matthew on her team, but unfortunately for her, Blake also turned around. He made a very good case, noting that three of his past six winners were not country singers, stating, "It doesn't matter what lane your coach is in. It's what lane your coach can put you in." Combine that with the fact that Grandma McQueen had dreamed that Blake would turn for Matthew, and it was a done deal. Now Blake might win again with another non-country artist. "With his range and his pocket -- this guy is a threat to this entire competition," Blake proclaimed.
The Battles kicked off on The Voice with new mentors and a new rule. Among the Blind Auditions was Matthew McQueen, who captured the attention of the coaches with his star power and unique voice. John Legend compared him to a handsome movie villain, while Kelly Clarkson called him cool and sexy. Blake Shelton praised Matthew's vocals, likening them to heartthrob Shawn Mendes. Ultimately, both Kelly and Blake turned their chairs for Matthew, but it was Blake who won him over. With his range and talent, Matthew is now a threat in the competition.

Between my two long flights, I barely had time to grab some food to tide me over. So with 5 minutes until my plane boards, I decided to grab a sandwich from a counter-service barbecue restaurant that had no line and barely anyone sitting at its tables. I figured it would be fastest, since there was no line.
