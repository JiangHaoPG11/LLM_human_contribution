Russia's controversial "sovereign internet" law has officially come into effect. The law grants the Russian government the power to control and potentially isolate the country's internet infrastructure from the global network. Critics argue that this move will further restrict freedom of speech and increase state surveillance. Proponents, however, claim that it is necessary for national security and protection against cyber threats. The law has raised concerns among internet freedom advocates and has been seen as a step towards increasing censorship and control over online content in Russia.

"What's that, 7,000? Nah, I need more like 15. That was pretty light," Ayton quipped....

But Watson spun away, sprinted to his right and darted a 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Darren Fells to erase the Raiders' four-point lead. "It's still on me," Key said...

WASHINGTON (AP)   Liberal and conservative justices seemed split on whether to grant a new sentencing hearing to Lee Boyd Malvo, who as a teenager was one of two snipers who terrorized the Washington area, killing 10 people. The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on whether Malvo was wrongly sentenced in Virginia to life without parole. Malvo was 17 at the time of the killings.

The Supreme Court is divided on whether to grant a new sentencing hearing to Lee Boyd Malvo, one of the snipers responsible for the Washington area killings in 2002. The court heard arguments on Wednesday regarding Malvo's sentence of life without parole, which his attorneys argue was unjust. The main point of contention is whether Malvo's age at the time of the crimes should be taken into consideration. The justices' opinions appear to be split along ideological lines, with liberal and conservative justices holding differing views on the matter.

Members of the US armed forces were left amused on the morning of September 11 after a moose disregarded barriers at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, and wandered inside. Colonel Lori Everett, who works as a dentist in the air force, was on her way to work at Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson when she spotted the moose. Everett was in a line of vehicle traffic that was brought to a standstill by the animal. Everett joked on Facebook that the moose "heeded the stop sign, but totally ignored the SF troop." She told Storyful that the video did not show the three or four "other Security Force troops who were standing behind the support pillars as a protective front, peeking to the side to gauge the direction of travel of said moose." "It was a great way to start the day!" she added. Credit: Col. Lori Everett via Storyful

Real talk. Demi Moore got candid about a variety of topics in her new book, Inside Out, including her famous exes, substance abuse struggles and her heartbreaking sexual assault. "The same question kept going through my head: How did I get here?" the 56-year-old actress began in the memoir, which was released on Tuesday, September 24. "The husband who I'd thought was the love of my life had cheated on me and then decided he didn't want to work on our marriage. My children weren't speaking me. … Is this life? I wondered. Because if this is it, I'm done." Moore provided insight into all three of her marriages in the book. She was married to Freddy Moore from 1980 to 1985, Bruce Willis from 1987 to 2000 and Ashton Kutcher from 2005 to 2013. The end of the G.I. Jane star's relationship with the former That 70's Show star, however, seemed to have the biggest impact on her. "I lost me," the Ghost actress told Diane Sawyer on Good Morning America on Monday, September 23, about their split. "I think the thing if I were to look back, I would say I blinded myself and I lost myself." Moore and Kutcher, who is 15 years her junior, started dating in 2003. After Us Weekly broke the news that he was allegedly unfaithful in 2011, the twosome called it quits. The Ranch star married Mila Kunis in July 2015. They share two kids: Wyatt, 4, and Dimitri, 2. Kutcher, for his part, reflected on the divorce during an appearance on Dax Shepard's "Armchair Expert" podcast last year. "Right after I got divorced, I went to the mountains for a week by myself," Kutcher told Shepard in February 2018. "I did no food, no drink   just water and tea. I took all my computers away, my phone, my everything. I was there by myself, so there was no talking. I just had a notepad, a pen and water and tea   for a week." He referred to the trip as "really spiritual and kind of awesome." "I wrote down every single relationship that I had where I felt like there was some grudge or some anything, regret, anything," Kutcher explained. "And I wrote letters to every single person, and on day seven, I typed them all out and then sent them." While Moore certainly doesn't hold back in Inside Out, a source told Us earlier this month that the Kutcher isn't worried about the book. "Ashton knew what was coming. He had a heads up on what is in the book," the insider said on September 13. "He's not mad or disappointed. This is Demi's truth, and he always felt sympathetic toward her. He knows her story and that her upbringing was difficult." Inside Out is available now. Scroll through for 10 revelations from the book:

Gus is a 2,000 pound bull who lives on a beautiful farm in Millbrook, Ontario. He is a true gentle giant with a gentle disposition and a friendly nature. He wanders among his herd of cows who are also very happy here on this small chunk of paradise. They have hundreds of acres of lush, green meadow to graze on and ponds full of fresh water to drink. They even have a scratching post with brushes for soothing those itches. Gus is a big boy with big ears and a big itch inside one of them. He patiently waited for his turn at the post while Ethel had a good scratch. When he had the chance, he moved in for some relief. He rubbed his head and his ear and he seemed intent on trying to fit the big brush inside his ear to get at the right spot. Gus' buddy, Dave was watching all of this. Dave had come over for a visit that day, bringing Gus' favorite treat, an entire loaf of bread. Gus had devoured the loaf in under a minute and now he was a happy bull, except of the itch in his ear. Dave watched Gus trying his best to scratch that itch. In fact, the entire herd was gathered around Gus and they watched him as well. Eventually, Dave thought it best to lend a hand. Gus could use a little help from somebody with fingers and thumbs who could do a better job. Not all bulls would allow this, and not all bulls would even permit somebody to get so close to his females, but Gus is as relaxed as a bull can be. Dave walked up and started rubbing Gus' massive ear. Gus obviously appreciated the assistance and he moved his head to make things easier. He let out a few "moos" of contentment and then he wandered away. As Gus takes a few steps away from the brushes, we get a great look at his massive shoulders and rippling muscles. He weighs as much as ten very solid, grown men. Maybe it's because Gus isn't threatened by anything, or maybe it's sheer luck that he's so relaxed, but he doesn't ever react with aggression or hostility. Of course, trying to scratch the ear of a grown bull, or even getting this close to one, is not always wise. Gus is definitely an exception and, even at that, his massive size and strength make him an animal to be respected.
Gus, a 2,000-pound bull living on a farm in Millbrook, Ontario, is known for his gentle nature and friendly disposition. Recently, he was seen trying to scratch an itch inside his ear using a scratching post with brushes. His friend, Dave, who had come to visit, decided to lend a hand and started rubbing Gus' ear. Gus appreciated the assistance and let out contented "moos" before wandering away. Despite his relaxed demeanor, Gus's massive size and strength serve as a reminder that he is an animal to be respected.

Severely cracked soil and a dried up riverbed is all that's left of Moree's Mehi River in drought-affected northern New South Wales, according to a video posted to Instagram by a local. In a post Moree local Kat (@the_freckled_kat) said "The drought goes on…the cracks in the riverbed are wider than my work boots, the dust is now a constant companion and the water no longer flows. We aren't even in the worst affected area." A comparison photo posted to Instagram by Kat shows the river at the same spot in May 2018. The Department of Primary Industries has declared the entire Moree Plains area of New South Wales to be in intense drought. The drought affecting New South Wales and Queensland has forced new announcements of funding from politicians, including a $1 billion investment into dam infrastructure by the NSW Government and a $100 million package by the federal government in September. The Bureau of Meteorology expects this year's warm and dry trend for the eastern states to continue for the remainder of 2019. Credit: @the_freckled_kat via Storyful
